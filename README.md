# JavaSwingBirthday

As part of my journey learning computer science, I wanted to create a simple, 
yet interesting project to challenge myself to use concepts i have learned in class.

Rather than making a typical calculator, thought i build a fun and unique animated app with java.

## 💡 Features
- GUI (using  Java Swing)
- Timer logic
- Dynamic visuals (Color changing, animation)
- Runs from the console

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Java JDK 8 or above

I kept it simple since its my first project commited to GitHub


## How to Run
1. Compile:
   ```bash
   javac Birthday.java
   java Birthday.java
